# 🕸️ Semantic Web Crawler with Transformers + FAISS

This is a semantic-aware web crawler that uses Hugging Face Transformers to extract meaningful content from websites, filters noise, and stores clean text embeddings in a FAISS index for downstream applications like fine-tuning or RAG.

## 🚀 Features
- Crawls a website and recursively follows internal links
- Uses Transformers (e.g., BART, MiniLM) to summarize or filter valuable content
- Embeds the content using SentenceTransformers
- Stores embeddings in a FAISS vector store
- Ready for integration with LangChain or custom LLM training

## 🛠 Usage
